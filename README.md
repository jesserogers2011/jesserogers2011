- 👋 Hi, I’m @jesserogers2011
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about SQL.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use CASE statements, JOIN, TEMP tables in support of my job as a program manager because I really enjoy understanding the queries and jobs as opposed to just seeing the output.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on personal finance tips. I'd love to use the amazon mint tagger to get my order history into mint and automate more of my budgeting.
- 📫 How to reach me jessealanrogers@gmail.com via email.
